# Drill Vehicle: Design Specifications

## Overview
The drill is the player's primary tool and avatar in the world. Its design must communicate power, progression, and functionality.

## 1. Core Identity
- **In-Game Name:** The "Sand Worm" Mk I
- **Overall Vibe:** Rugged, industrial, but with a touch of advanced tech. Think NASA rover meets construction equipment.

## 2. Visual Design by Tier
Define how the drill looks and changes at each upgrade level.

| Tier | Name | Visual Description | Key Differentiating Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Rustbucket | Faded paint, rust spots, small drill bit, exposed wiring. | Basic, barely functional. |
| **2** | Workhorse | Cleaner paint, reinforced chassis, medium drill bit. | Looks reliable. |
| **3** | Depth Runner | Sleek alloy body, larger bit, glowing engine vents. | Looks fast and efficient. |
| **4** | Pharaoh's Bore | Gold and cobalt accents, massive laser-tipped drill, particle effects. | Looks legendary and powerful. |

## 3. Functional Attributes
How each tier affects gameplay.

| Tier | Dig Speed | Fuel Efficiency | Max Depth | Special Ability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1x | 1x | 500m | None |
| 2 | 1.5x | 1.2x | 1000m | +5% gold chance |

## 4. Animation & Feedback
How the drill communicates its state to the player.

- **Upgrade Complete:** Brilliant light flash and a satisfying "CHUNK" sound effect.

## 5. Sound Design
