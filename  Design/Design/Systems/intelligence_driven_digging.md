# Intelligence-Driven Digging System

## Overview
This document outlines the core gameplay loop of **Project Chimera**, which shifts the focus from mindless, endless digging to a strategic, intelligence-driven excavation process. The player uses technology and expert interpretation to make informed decisions on where to dig, managing risk and reward.

## Core Philosophy: Dig Smart, Not Hard
The goal is to make the player feel like a **Field Director**, not a laborer. Every dig site is a calculated risk based on the best available data.

## The Three Pillars of the System

### 1. Scanning (The "Sensor Sweep")
The player actively uses the drill's onboard systems to gather raw data about the surrounding geology.

#### Mechanics:
- **Action:** Player activates a scan from the drill's UI.
- **Cost:** Consumes a significant amount of fuel (e.g., 15% of tank capacity).
- **Output:** Returns a "Sensor Readout" â€“ a messy, non-literal image of the surrounding area for a limited radius.
- **Upgrades:** Improve clarity, range, and reduce fuel cost.
    - **Sonar:** Best for identifying large cavities (chambers, tunnels).
    - **GPR (Ground-Penetrating Radar):** Best for distinguishing material densities (ore veins vs. rock).
    - **LIDAR:** (Late Game) Creates precise 3D maps of voids.
