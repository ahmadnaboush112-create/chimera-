## Environment Concept: The Pyramids

### Setting
- A sprawling desert surrounding a massive, intricately modeled pyramid.
- The player establishes an expedition camp at the base.
- The pyramid features multiple entry points, hidden passages, and ancient symbols.

### Key Environmental Elements
- **Terrain:** Sand dunes, rocky outcrops, partially buried ruins.
- **Structures:** The pyramid as a central monument, with smaller ruins scattered around.
- **Atmosphere:** Harsh sunlight, occasional sandstorms, day/night cycle.

## Gameplay Loop

### Surface Activities
1. **Base Building:** Place and upgrade mining machinery, staff shelters, and research tents.
2. **Resource Management:** Allocate fuel, assign staff, manage supply lines.
3. **Exploration:** Discover hidden entrances, archaeological clues, and rare resources above ground.

### Underground Integration
- Surface actions affect underground progression:
  - Better equipment → deeper digging.
  - Discovered clues → unlock secret chambers.
  - Staff assignments → resource bonuses or hazard protection.

## UI/UX Proposal

### Expedition Camp Interface
- **Top Bar:** Resources (fuel, money, artifacts), current objectives.
- **Central Viewport:** 3D interactive view of the camp and pyramid (drag/rotate/zoom).
- **Sidebar (Left):** Build menu (drills, tents, storage).
- **Sidebar (Right):** Expedition log, discovered clues, event notifications.
- **Bottom Panel:** Task selection, staff management, settings.
