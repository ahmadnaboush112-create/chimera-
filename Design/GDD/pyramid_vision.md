# Project Chimera: Pyramid Biome Design Vision

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a pyramid-themed surface biome, expanding the core mining gameplay into a strategic, narrative-rich expedition experience.

---

## Environment Concept: The Pyramids

### Setting
- A sprawling desert surrounding a massive, intricately modeled pyramid.
- The player establishes an expedition camp at the base.
- The pyramid features multiple entry points, hidden passages, and ancient symbols.

### Key Environmental Elements
- **Terrain:** Sand dunes, rocky outcrops, partially buried ruins.
- **Structures:** The pyramid as a central monument, with smaller ruins scattered around.
- **Atmosphere:** Harsh sunlight, occasional sandstorms, day/night cycle.

## Gameplay Loop

### Surface Activities
1. **Base Building:** Place and upgrade mining machinery, staff shelters, and research tents.
2. **Resource Management:** Allocate fuel, assign staff, manage supply lines.
3. **Exploration:** Discover hidden entrances, archaeological clues, and rare resources above ground.
4. ## Upgrade System

### Purpose
To provide meaningful progression, player goals, and a core monetization hook through permanent improvements.

### Upgrade Categories
| Category          | Examples                          | Effect                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Drill**         | Basic → Diamond Drill            | Dig speed + break tougher rocks        |
| **Fuel Tank**     | Small → Reinforced Tank          | Longer digging sessions                |
| **Cargo Hold**    | Bag → Wagon                      | Carry more ore per trip                |
| **Scanner**       | Basic Radar → Sonar              | Reveal hidden ore & chambers           |
| **Artifact Tools**| Brush → X-Ray Scanner            | Extract artifacts safely               |

### Economy
- Upgrades purchased with **Gold** (from selling ore)
- Higher tiers may require **Gems** or **Artifacts** found deeper underground

## Task & Objective System

### Task Board
Accessible from the surface camp UI. Offers:

- **Daily Tasks**: "Mine 50 Gold Ore" → Reward: Gold + Premium Currency
- **Story Objectives**: "Reach the Burial Chamber" → Unlocks new area
- **Biome Challenges**: "Excavate 5 Golden Scarabs" → Exclusive skin

### Staff Assignments
Assign staff to roles for bonuses:

- **Geologists**: Increase rare ore discovery
- **Engineers**: Drill durability + fuel efficiency
- **Archeologists**: Uncover clues and artifacts faster

### Underground Integration
- Surface actions affect underground progression:
  - Better equipment → deeper digging.
  - Discovered clues → unlock secret chambers.
  - Staff assignments → resource bonuses or hazard protection.

## UI/UX Proposal

### Expedition Camp Interface
- **Top Bar:** Resources (fuel, money, artifacts), current objectives.
- **Central Viewport:** 3D interactive view of the camp and pyramid (drag/rotate/zoom).
- **Sidebar (Left):** Build menu (drills, tents, storage).
- **Sidebar (Right):** Expedition log, discovered clues, event notifications.
- **Bottom Panel:** Task selection, staff management, settings.
